V 1.0.2
+ Now supports ASCII encoding for images and approach curves from SECMx control software
+ Added "Bug report & feature request" menu page that links to the project github.
+ The most recent directory is now 'remembered' during the operation of a given app.
= Change made to the .txt exporting functions so that the data that is exported can be more easily read and plotted by plotting software.
= Split-up the monster script flux_v1.py into class scripts for the apps and menus.
= Fixed an equation in the theory page for the approach curve app.
= Bugfix that fixed the pre-Canny algorithm Image interpolation interpolating to a 1,1 size image when there were negative values in self.xpos.
= Bugfix that fixed the pre-Canny algorithm Image interpolation interpolating to a 1,1 size image for nanoscale SECM images.
= Bugfix where the approach curve kappa fitting tried to fit negative values for kappa, causing runtime errors.
= Bugfix that prevents Rg < 1 from being considered in the fit Rg, causing runtime errors when calculating the positive feedback curve.
= Fixed bug 001 wherein a runtime error was possible to occur if the status of a checkbox was changed from FALSE to TRUE between plotting data and exporting it.
